## About the Project
 This project was created for the grade 10 computer science course. 

 The objective of this game is to eliminate all of the balls rolling around the screen along a given path. To accomplish this, you must try to   
 connect 3 or more of the same coloured balls in a row, which will automatically delete these three balls. You will have a shooter on your 
 screen with a randomly-coloured ball, and you must identify the best place to shoot this ball to connect 3 or more in a row. 

## Built with
 This project was built using <a href = "https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href = "https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml">PyGame</a>. To run this program, you MUST have both Python and PyGame downloaded.
